It’s about using the language and devices that are\n                present in plays to tell an abstract story, but also has a\n                philosophical side. The big question is: are the characters’s\n                destinies in a play preordained or do the choices that they make\n                affect the outcome of the said play?

Also, the bell\n                is a character!

It’s\n                self reflective theater in that the question is raised: Do you\n                have to act in the play that you’re in or can you choose to go\n                and be in another play?
